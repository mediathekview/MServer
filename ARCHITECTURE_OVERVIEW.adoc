= Architecture Overview
:toc: macro

MServer is a free open-source software that crawls the media libraries of the German-speaking public broadcasters and prepares them as a machine-readable list for clients such as https://github.com/mediathekview/MediathekView[MediathekView].

== Context

image:docs/architecture/images/System_Context.svg[System context]

A simplified overview of the MediathekView system context.

=== Administrator (user)

The only real user of MServer is the administrator who configures and runs it.

=== Public broadcaster media libraries (external system)

Each public broadcaster media library is an own external system and needs its own crawler.
For some media libraries, no API exists, in which case the website itself is examined.

=== MediathekView (external system)

https://github.com/mediathekview/MediathekView[MediathekView] is the main supported client in the form of a desktop application.

=== MediathekViewWeb (external system)

https://github.com/mediathekview/MediathekViewWeb[MediathekViewWeb] is the second most important client in the form of a web application.

=== Other clients (external system)

Other clients like https://github.com/mediathekview/zapp[Zapp]
, https://github.com/mediathekview/plugin.video.mediathekview[MediathekView Kodi Plugin] and other, often unknown, clients.

== Quality Goals

[cols="<,>"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Motivation/description

|Easy to configure and operate (Configurability) |For the administrator, it is very easy and quick to configure and operate MServer
|Good performance (Efficiency) |The application runs very fast and uses the system resources as good as possible
|Machine-readable output (Interoperability) |Results are machine-readable and easy for clients to consume
|Good maintainability |It's easy to change and adapt to the changes in the media libraries
|Good reliability |It doesn't crash despite errors, but continues to run until its task is completed

== Solution Strategy

[cols="<,>"]
|===
|Quality Goal |Matching approaches in the solution

|Easy to configure and operate (Configurability) a|
* A YAML configuration file for the entire application with overridable default values and comments in the configuration
* Packaged as executable JAR and Docker container
|Good performance (Efficiency) |Using the Java Fork/Join framework to run all crawlers at the same time and divide up their work
|Machine-readable output (Interoperability) |The results can be saved as a normal JSON file or as the custom JSON-like legacy format used by the old server
|Good maintainability a|
* Each media library has its own crawler which is stored in its own package
* The Java version and dependencies are kept up to date
* Clean code is emphasized and checked via SonarQube
* Every change is reviewed via a code review

|Good reliability |All exceptions are handled and none are passed through to the outside

== Architectural Overview Diagram

An informal architecture overview diagram for MServer

=== YAML Configuration

How many threads are allowed to use, which crawlers should run and crawler configurations are set in the YAML configuration of MServer.

=== Yacl4J

A library to read the YAML configuration as objects.

=== Crawler Manager

Starts all configured crawlers, collects the results and start the filmlist writing.

=== AbstractCrawler

Contains basic logic needed in every crawler like the work splitting.

=== Crawler

The heart of MServer crawlers for the public broadcaster media libraries.
